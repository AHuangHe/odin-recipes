    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. 
      Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. 
      I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. 
      These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!
    </p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 Hamburger Buns</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter, softened, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 pound Ground Chuck Beef <strong>(80% lean)</strong></li>
      <li>4 6-inch squares Parchment Paper</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>4 slices American Cheese </li>
      <li>Burger Toppings of choice <strong>(Optional)</strong></li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
      <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. <strong> Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly.</strong></li>
      <li>Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the patula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty).</li>
      <li>Immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. (You may also use the bottom of a small skillet)</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the meat with salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color.</li>
      <li>Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over, and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese.</li>
      <li>Grill an additional <strong>15 to 20 seconds</strong>; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks</li>
      <li>Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
